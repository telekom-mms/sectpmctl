# sectpmctl 1.1.3

**Warning: It is highly recommended to install sectpmctl on a fresh Ubuntu installation as you could run into problems when the tpm2-tools
or efitools can't be executed successfully on your device. Create at least a backup of your data before installation. If you already
installed DKMS modules, it is probably neccessary to rebuild them after installing sectpmctl to have then signed.**

We want to secure the Ubuntu 22.04 installation with LUKS and TPM2. Please read this README carefully before installation.

We assume a normal installation of Ubuntu 22.04 desktop with erasing the disk and using LVM and encryption. Don't select to create a recovery
key, only the LUKS password. A preseed installation is possible but currently undocumented. Other Linux distribution can probably be supported
in future releases.

If you are not using the TPM + password option you should supply a BIOS start password. Without either a BIOS start password or
TPM + password, the device would boot up to the login screen and someone could try to read out the memory or find a bug in the login
screen to recover the LUKS key.

Either way you should also supply a BIOS admin password.

Dual booting Windows is not recommended and has never been tested with sectpmctl. The risk is that Windows will update the Secure Boot DBX
database which will prevent the successfull unlocking of the LUKS key. In such case you need the recovery key and need to redo the sectpmctl
installation, see 'Recovery' for more information.

It is recommended to only have one LUKS slot in use before installation, which is mostly slot 0. sectpmctl will additionally use slot 5 to
store the TPM key.

You can easily test the installation with virt-manager on a Ubuntu 22.04 host and a Ubuntu 22.04 guest. When creating a new VM you need to
configure the VM before it starts automatically. In the overview select 'OVMF_CODE_4M.secboot.fd' as firmware and then add a new 'TPM
emulated TIS 2.0' device. After installation of Ubuntu you can start installing sectpmctl.

For transparency the tpm2-tools commands for session encryption, provisioning, TOFU, seal, unseal and password change are documented at the end
of this README. The commands for using Secure Boot are standard with the exception of using the TPM as keystore for the db signing key. Take a
look in the source code to see how that works. If you are wondering, yes the PK and KEK key's are not stored at all in the current
implementation, they are simply not needed for anything.

## Features

* TPM2 backed FDE
* Provisions the TPM with sane settings in a minimal way
* Encrypts communication to and from the TPM
* Uses the trust on first use (TOFU) principle. The bonding happens at TPM provisioning time
* Passwordless or TPM + password option
  + Passwordless option is not influenced by DA lockout
  + TPM + Password option is influenced by DA lockout
  + Secure Boot signing is not influenced by DA lockout
* The Secure Boot signing key is backed by the TPM as well
* Zero TPM administrative overhead by managing Secure Boot instead of the TPM
  + Secure Boot is more easy to manage
  + FDE key is only bound to the Secure Boot state, not to userspace
  + Maybe immune to BIOS updates
  + Immune to operating system upgrades
  + No postprocessing other then kernel and initrd signing required
  + Interrupted update of new kernels should still keep old kernels bootable
  + Additional installation of other bootloaders will not overwrite sectpmctl, they are placed alongside
* Can be integrated in a nearly fullly automated preseed installation
  + The only upfront action is to clear TPM and Secure Boot
* The secureboot database is completly rebuild with own keys and (by default) Microsoft keys for safety reasons
* Uses and integrates systemd-stub and systemd-boot as bootloader, does not invent a new one
* Optional ommitting of Microsoft Secure Boot keys on supported hardware
* Option to forget the lockout authorization password set while TPM provisioning
* Option to set and forget an endorsement password while TPM provisioning
* Implemented in bash

Using a splash screen and the TPM + Password option does not work. If that happens you can enter the password blind, it will work.

## Security and privacy options

### Lockout authorization password

Setting the authorization password to a random value without storing it enhances security, because the lockout hierarchy can not be
modified without password after TPM provisioning. This hierarchy also prevents accidental use of the tpm2_clear command. If you know
that you need access to the lockout hierarchy, you should remove the option '--forgetlockout' from the 'sudo sectpmctl tpm provisioning'
command in the installation section. If this option is not set, the lockout password is stored in '/var/lib/sectpmctl/keys/lockout.pwd'.
You can change this option also at a later time by reinstalling sectpmctl again (see the recovery section for how to do it).

### Endorsement authorization password

Setting the endorsement authorization password to a random value without storing it enhances privacy, because the endorsement hierarchy
can be used to uniquely identify your device. If you know that you need access to the endorsement hierarchy, you should remove the
option '--setforgetendorsement' from the 'sudo sectpmctl tpm provisioning' command in the installation section. When this option is
not set, the endorsement authorization password will be empty. You can change this option also at a later time by reinstalling
sectpmctl again (see the recovery section for how to do it).

### One optional setting is dangerous (disabled by default)

When installing the sectpmct bootloader, the Microsoft keys are automatically uploaded to the Secure Boot database for your own safety.
An option exist to suppress uploading of the Microsoft keys. Together with an BIOS admin password, hardware without an crucial UEFI OptionROM
requirement like laptops with integrated graphics gain the protection that no other operating system is able to boot. This should probably
also increase security on another end. When sectpmctl is installed without a TPM password, the device will boot unattended (if there is no
BIOS startup password or if it has been removed). When the system would be able to execute bootloaders signed by Microsoft, it could be
possible that an attacker can boot a software which tries to read out the memory from the last boot to get access to the LUKS key which is
still in the DDR RAM still for some seconds. Disabling booting any other bootloader will prevent this relative simple attack. And even if
the attacker is able to put his own or Microsoft key's into the Secure Boot database, sectpmctl rejects to boot automatically in first place
because PCR 7 would be invalid. When this option is used together with an BIOS administrator password (with or without the TPM password),
this should also increase protection from the RAM attack if the laptop is stolen when in standby provided the attacker is not able break
the BIOS administrator password. Another benefit is, when the device is stolen, that the thief can not sell the device anymore as it won't boot
any other operating system.

But this option is highly dangerous. When it is used on a device (typically servers and desktops or laptoips with a dedicated PCI graphic card)
where the hardware strictly requires the Microsoft keys you will for sure at least semi brick or completly brick the device.

**Do NOT use the --withoutmicrosoftkeys option of the sectpmctl boot install tool when:**

 * You don't know what the Microsoft UEFI CA key is used for
 * You have a dedicated NVidia RTX/GTX or AMD Radeon graphic card in a desktop or laptop
 * You have PCI card's in use which are related to booting (storage, network, etc)

Do use the option with care when:

 * You know the implications and have a supported device

In case of graphic cards for example, when ommitting the Microsoft keys, the screen will stay black when you power on the device. It will
not even work when the operating system is finished booting. If you are (very) lucky, you could maybe navigate blindly in the BIOS to disable
Secure Boot. Then, on the next start, the graphic card will function again. You can then restore the Secure Boot factory keys and enable Secure Boot
again. Another option is maybe to buy a very old graphic card or a CPU with integrated graphics to recover. On laptops it is not possible
to switch to another graphic card for booting and the brick could be final, immutable and can maybe never be recovered.

The sbctl project has a FAQ for the Microsoft keys: https://github.com/Foxboron/sbctl/wiki/FAQ#option-rom

This option will only work when you enter the Clear Mode in the Secure Boot BIOS settings, that is when the complete Secure Boot database
is empty. If you enter the Setup Mode (only the PK key is cleared instead of the complete Secure Boot database) this option won't work.

A differentiation of the Microsoft Windows and the Microsoft UEFI key is currently not done. Either both or none will be installed.

**You have been warned, it is highly possible to destroy your system without being able to fix it! Do an internet search before using this
option and ask somebody who might know if it could work. If you brik your device you are on your own. Use on your own risc!**

  util-linux gdisk openssl uuid-runtime tpm2-tools fdisk

git clone https://github.com/T-Systems-MMS/sectpmctl.git

cd sectpmctl
make package_build
cd ..
```

## Install sectpmctl

Warning: After removing grub and shim there is no alternative then to complete the installation, otherwise your system will most probably
not boot anymore.

### Prerequisite

#### Secure Boot preparations

Your BIOS has to be in Secure Boot Setup Mode. That means that your BIOS need to have Secure Boot enabled and that all keys are cleared. You
can do so by entering your BIOS, enable Secure Boot and find inside the Secure Boot section the button to "Clear all keys".

We never came across a BIOS which does not offer a way to enter Secure Boot Setup Mode. If your BIOS supports listing all keys, after entering
the setup mode, the amount of keys of all databases should be listed as zero. If your Secure Boot settings are grayed out, you most probably
have to set a BIOS administrator first.

First check if your Secure Boot is enabled and cleared by executing this two commands:

```
mokutil --sb-state
efi-readvar
```

The output should look like this:

```
user@laptop:~$ mokutil --sb-state
SecureBoot disabled
Platform is in Setup Mode
user@laptop:~$ efi-readvar
Variable PK has no entries
Variable KEK has no entries
Variable db has no entries
Variable dbx has no entries
Variable MokList has no entries
user@laptop:~$
```

#### TPM preparations

As sectpmctl will provision your TPM in a minimal way it is required to start the installation with a cleared TPM. That can be achived in three
ways:

- Clear the TPM (sometimes also called Security Chip) in the BIOS if available. Some BIOS types require you press a key after a reboot to clear
the TPM.
- Use Windows to disable TPM autoprovisioning and clear the TPM by using PowerShell commands, followed by a reboot.
- Execute in Linux: "echo 5 | sudo tee /sys/class/tpm/tpm0/ppi/request" and reboot.

Be warned that if you put already some keys into the TPM, they will be lost by the clearing.

Be also warned that when a TPM lockout password is set and you try to clear the TPM with software commands entering a wrong lockout password,
there will be a time penalty until you can try again. The above three ways to clear should allow to clear the TPM even when you entered a wrong
lockout password.

To check if the TPM is in a good state enter:

```
sudo tpm2_getcap properties-variable
```

The output should look like this:

```
user@laptop:~$ sudo tpm2_getcap properties-variable
...
  lockoutAuthSet:            0
...
  inLockout:                 0
...
user@laptop:~$
```

The command which will be executed later while installing, "sectpmctl tpm provisioning", should run successfully with a cleared TPM and the
output should look like this:

```
user@laptop:~$ sudo sectpmctl tpm provisioning
START PROVISIONING
## TPM CLEAR
## SET DICTIONARY LOCKOUT SETTINGS
## CREATE AND SET THE LOCKOUTAUTH VALUE
## CREATE PERSISTENT PRIMARY OWNER SRK AT 0x81000100
## CREATE PERSISTENT PRIMARY OWNER NODA SRK AT 0x81000101
user@laptop:~$
```

The provisioning will set a random lockout password which is stored in '/var/lib/sectpmctl/keys/lockout.pwd', set sane dictionary attack lockout
time penalty settings and create two TPM primary keys, one with the dictionary attack lockout flag (DA) and one without (NODA).

The following DA lockout values are set:

- Wrong password retry count = 32 tries
- Recovery time = 10 minutes
- Lockout recovery time = 30 minutes

Unsealing the LUKS key while booting without TPM + password and signing of kernels and kernel modules is done by using the NODA primary key to
not break updates in case of a dictionary lockout situation. When using the TPM + password option, the unsealing while booting is done with the
DA key, while keep using the NODA key for signing kernels and kernel modules. 

All generated keys, passwords or serialized keys are stored in '/var/lib/sectpmctl/keys'.

### Installation

```
# 1. Point of no return, you need to complete at least until the following reboot command
sudo apt remove --allow-remove-essential "grub*" "shim*"
sudo dpkg -i sectpmctl_1.1.3-1_amd64.deb
sudo apt install -yf

# optionally disable swap while keys are created
sudo swapoff -a

# 2. TPM Provisioning
sudo sectpmctl tpm provisioning --forgetlockout --setforgetendorsement


# 3. Cleanup leftovers from grub, shim and windows with efibootmgr
while [[ $(efibootmgr | grep -c -m 1 "Windows Boot Manager") -gt 0 ]]
do
  entryId=$(efibootmgr -v | grep -m 1 -i "Windows Boot Manager" | sed -e 's/^Boot\([0-9]\+\)\(.*\)$/\1/')
  sudo efibootmgr -q -b "${entryId}" -B
done
while [[ $(efibootmgr | grep -c -m 1 "ubuntu") -gt 0 ]]
do
  entryId=$(efibootmgr -v | grep -m 1 -i "ubuntu" | sed -e 's/^Boot\([0-9]\+\)\(.*\)$/\1/')
  sudo efibootmgr -q -b "${entryId}" -B
done
while [[ $(efibootmgr | grep -c -m 1 "SECTPMCTL Bootloader") -gt 0 ]]
do

  sudo efibootmgr -q -b "${entryId}" -B
done


# 4. Now migrate boot partition to root, the following partition table is assumed, change all
# references according to your device and partition names and numbers:

# $DISK          -> /dev/vda (the disk)
# $EFIPARTITION  -> /dev/vda1 (EFI-System, vfat, partition type 1)
# $BOOTPARTITION -> /dev/vda2 (boot partition, ext4)
# $LUKSPARTITION -> /dev/vda3 (encrypted root partition)

sudo umount /boot/efi
sudo umount /boot
sudo mkdir /oldboot
sudo mount /dev/$BOOTPARTITION /oldboot
sudo cp -rp /oldboot/* /boot/
sudo umount /oldboot
sudo rmdir /oldboot

sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/$EFIPARTITION bs=1M
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/$BOOTPARTITION bs=1M
sudo fdisk /dev/$DISK
  # delete partition $BOOTPARTITION (e.g. vda2)
  # delete partition $EFIPARTITION (e.g. vda1)
  # create new parttion $EFIPARTITION (e.g. vda1)
    # startsector same as startsector of old $EFIPARTITION
    # lastsector same as lastsector of old $BOOTPARTITION
    # remove signature: YES
  # change type of partition $EFIPARTITION (e.g. vda1)
    # type nr: 1 (EFI-System)
  # write and quit
sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/$EFIPARTITION
sudo blkid -s UUID -o value /dev/$EFIPARTITION
  # copy the UUID of /dev/$EFIPARTITION, something like: 00A5-1112
sudo vi /etc/fstab
  # remove /boot entry from fstab
  # change the old UUID of /boot/efi to the copied new UUID of the blkid output
sudo mount /boot/efi


# 5. Install the bootloader
sudo sectpmctl boot install

# TODO: Describe how to reinstall or rebuild all installed or build DKMS kernel
# modules to have them resigned.

# After this reboot your current LUKS password is still required
sudo reboot


# 6. Install the LUKS TPM implementation
# optionally disable swap while keys are created
sudo swapoff -a

# Now your machine has its own set of Secure Boot keys, test it
sudo sectpmctl boot test

# Install the LUKS TPM key. Enter your current LUKS key when asked.
cat > install_tpm.sh <<__EOT
#! /bin/bash
echo -n "Enter TPM Password: "
read -sr tpmpwda
echo
echo -n "Enter TPM Password again: "
read -sr tpmpwdb
echo
if [[ "x\${tpmpwda}" == "x\${tpmpwdb}" ]]; then
  sudo sectpmctl tpm install --setrecoverykey --password "\${tpmpwda}"
else
  echo "Passwords don't match. Exit"
  exit 1
fi
__EOT
chmod +x install_tpm.sh
./install_tpm.sh

# STORE THE PRINTED RECOVERY KEY NOW!!!
# SCROLL UP A BIT IF IT GET'S OUT OF SIGHT!!!

# Reboot to test the installation
sudo reboot
```

The 'sectpmctl tpm install' command will print out the recovery key. It is highly recommended to store this key in a safe location. Without this
key you can loose all your data when the TPM breaks or when accessing your hard disk in another machine. You have been warned!

The recovery key will be printed first, then the bootloader is update. It can happen that the recovery key is not visible after the
installation. Then you need to scroll up a bit to see it. The recovery key is build by eight groups with eight characters from 0 to 9 and a to
f which sums up to 256bit. If this is too long you can decrease the number of groups or the grouplength with the 'sectpmctl tpm' options
'--recoverygroups' and '--recoverygrouplength'. To create a shorter 192bit recovery key you can do so with 8 groups and a grouplength of 6.

After a reboot, the LUKS partition should decrypt automatically and the installation is complete.

You can then do some bootloader configuration by editing '/etc/sectpmctl/boot.conf'. Currently a splash screen should not be activated. It
is disabled by default. The kernel option "quiet" is supported, but disabled as well by default. Remember to update the bootloader afterwards
by executing:

```
sudo sectpmctl boot update
```

followed by a reboot. You can also use the bootctl command for basic tasks like listing the bootable kernels:

```
sudo bootctl list
```

By default, only kernels signed by Canonical are considered to be shown in the boot list. Unsigned kernels are ignored for safety reasons.
If you want do have support for all kernels, you can edit '/etc/sectpmctl/boot.conf', set 'SKIP_UNSIGNED_KERNELS' to 'false' and update the
bootloader with 'sectpmctl boot update'.

If the password option has been used, the current password can be changed at runtime. The TPM should not be in the DA lockout mode, otherwise
you have to wait up to 10 minutes.

```
cat > change_tpm_password.sh <<__EOT
#! /bin/bash
echo -n "Enter old TPM Password: "
read -sr tpmpwdold
echo
echo -n "Enter new TPM Password: "
read -sr tpmpwda
echo
echo -n "Enter new TPM Password again: "
read -sr tpmpwdb
echo
if [[ "x\${tpmpwda}" == "x\${tpmpwdb}" ]]; then
  sudo sectpmctl key changepassword --handle 0x81000102 --oldpassword "\${tpmpwdold}" --password "\${tpmpwda}"
else
  echo "Passwords don't match. Exit"
  exit 1
fi
__EOT
chmod +x change_tpm_password.sh
./change_tpm_password.sh
```

If the current password is lost, a new password can be set with the recovery key by installing again:

```
sectpmctl tpm install --setrecoverykey --password "mynewpassword"
```
      
## Updates

Remember that entering the recovery key while booting is the only option when sectpmctl will not unlock automatically anymore. See 'Recovery'
for how to fix.

### Kernel or kernel module updates

Kernel or kernel module updates will not create any problems.  Whenever a kernel update is installed or a new DKMS module or update to such,
the corresponding hooks are called to automatically sign the kernel and/or kernel modules in a very similar way like DKMS and grub for example
are doing updates.

### Userspace updates

No userspace application except bootloaders should be able to cause any problem anytime. It is better to not install any other bootloader. The
UEFI specification allows for many bootloaders being installed in parallel. No other bootloader will overwrite sectpmctl but most probably
change the boot order. In such case you can enter the bootmenu of your BIOS (often the F12 key or such) and select sectpmctl again as boot
entry. You can do it also permanently by using the efibootmgr command although it could be a bit of a fiddle.

### BIOS Updates, eventually even with an Secure Boot database update

It seems that BIOS updates on Lenovo Thinkpads won't cause problems as they seem to keep the Secure Boot database and won't reset the TPM.
All tested BIOS updates done so far did not result in preventing unsealing.

On the other hand on Gigabyte  X570S AERO motherboards,  the Secure Boot database seems to be reset during BIOS update, with the result that the recovery
password needs to be entered on the next boot and sectpmctl needs to be installed again.

If you know that Secure Boot and TPM stay stable there should be no problem in updating, otherwise keep your recovery password in reach. In
a future version, binding to PCR 0 and handling BIOS updates could be implemented. That requires either integration with fwupdatemgr or the
execution of a command infront of the BIOS update.

### Custom kernels or kernel modules

After installing sectpmctl, a key (db) to sign kernels and kernel modules is stored in the TPM in a serialized form in
'/var/lib/sectpmctl/keys/db.obj' for use with tpmsbsigntool. The key password is stored in '/var/lib/sectpmctl/keys/db.pwd'

You normally don't need to use the db key manually. DKMS and kernel hooks are integrated and execute the sign commands automatically
for every kind of Ubuntu upgrades. There are two helper scripts which behave like sbsign and kmodsign in '/usr/lib/sectpmctl/scripts' when you
need to sign things manually:

- sbsign.sh
- kmodsign.sh

You can even link the helper scripts over the sbsigntool executables by leveraging a debian config package if you need to do so,
for example to support maintainance of commercial antivirus applications or such.

You then need to supply a key and a certificate which are stored in '/var/lib/sectpmctl/keys/':

- db.obj (key)
- db.cer (certificate)
- db.crt (certificate)

Depending on the tool you either need the CER or the CRT file as certificate.

Please read the helper scripts before manual using them as they have specific needs for rewriting parameters. Hopefully the patches of
tpmsbsigntool can be merged upstream in sbsigntool in the future.

## Recovery

In case of a changed Secure Boot database, sectpmctl will not unlock anymore. In that case you can simply repeat the sectpmctl installation.
First clear the Secure Boot database, then clear the TPM and finally repeat all steps exept 1. and 4. from the installation. It is possible to
do it more fine grained which will be documented in a later release.

You could then omit the '--setrecoverykey' option in the 'sectpmctl tpm install' command to keep your current recovery key.

## TPM2 Internals

You can test the implementation on a fresh Ubuntu installation with a cleared TPM. The following snippets from Provisioning, Sealing with TPM
password, Unsealing with TPM password and Changing the TPM password are execetutable in this order.

### Used handles

The following persistant handles are created after provisioning and installation. The keyed hash is using one of the two parent objects.

| Handle | Object |
| ------ | ------ |
| 0x81000100 | Parent object with DA |
| 0x81000101 | Parent object with NODA |
| 0x81000102 | Keyed hash of LUKS key |

### List of PCR Values on Ubuntu

| PCR | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| 0 | BIOS |
| 1 | BIOS Config |
| 2 | Option ROM |
| 3 | Option ROM Config |
| 4 | Bootloaders and EFI Blobs |
| 5 | GPT Partition Table |
| 6 | Resume Events (seems not to work on Linux) |
| 7 | SecureBoot State |
| 8 | GRUB Bootloader Config |
| 9 | GRUB Bootloader Files |
| 10 |  |
| 11 | sectpmctl |
| 12 |  |
| 13 |  |
| 14 | shim Bootloader MOK |

### List of PCR values used by sectpmctl

| PCR | value |
| --- | ----- |
| 7 | Secureboot state |
| 8 | zero |
| 9 | zero |
| 11 | LUKS header |
| 14 | zero |

PCR8, 9 and 14 will be zero when sectpmctl is installed. MOK is not and should not be used. This is verified by binding the LUKS key to this
three zero values.

PCR11, the LUKS header, is measured while sealing in the installation and while unsealing by the initrd. It has a special purpose. After
unsealing the LUKS key in the initrd, PCR11 is extended with a random value. That blocks a second unsealing without having to extend a more
meaningful like PCR7.

### Provisioning

Performing a TPM provisioning is required for advanced usage. The TPM has to be partitioned and secured. This implementation does not make use
of the endorsement key, some users want to disable this hirarchy anyway for privacy reasons. It also does't set passwords for the owner hirarchy
because that will sooner or later create problems with software which simply would not allow to use an owner password, tpm2-topt for example.
The root user would be able to create new primary keys or even delete them, but that should not break security.

Setting a high entropy password for the endorsement hirarchy and deleting it afterwards could be an intresting option in future to disable
the endorsement hirarchy. An option for not storing the lockout authorization password could maybe a good thing in a future update. A recovery
can always be done by a reinstallation.

The two public keys 'tpm_owner.pub' and 'tpm_owner_noda.pub' play an important role. They are used for session encryption, but more importantly
they build the foundation of the TOFU principle. These public keys are used to establish a TPM session when unsealing in the initrd. If
the corresponding private key is not inside the TPM, then the communication is directly rejected. The public key is copied into the initrd and
of course signed by Secure Boot, so that manupulation of the public key won't boot. Deleting the private key in the TPM or using a different TPM
also won't boot. Only when the initrd finds the private keys created at provisioning time together with the initrd's public key, the encrypted
session is established.

```

```

### Session encryption and TOFU

When a session is established for sealing or unsealing, the public keys from the provisioning are used

```
# The tpm_owner_noda private key is available in the TPM

tpm2_startauthsession --policy-session --session="session.ctx" --key-context="tpm_owner_noda.pub"

tpm2_sessionconfig "session.ctx"
# -> Session-Attributes: continuesession|decrypt|encrypt
```

```
# The tpm_owner_noda private key is not available in the TPM

tpm2_startauthsession --policy-session --session="session.ctx" --key-context="tpm_owner_noda.pub"
# -> ERROR: Esys_StartAuthSession(0x18B) - tpm:handle(1):the handle is not correct for the use
```

### Sealing with TPM password

```
# Generate the secret
echo mysecret > INPUT_SECRET_FILE

# Foresee or read the PCR values into "pcr_values.dat"
tpm2_pcrread "sha256:7,8,9,11,14" --output="pcr_values.dat"

# Create trial PCR with authvalue policy session
tpm2_startauthsession --session="trialsession.ctx"

tpm2_policypcr --session="trialsession.ctx" --pcr-list="sha256:7,8,9,11,14" \
  --pcr="pcr_values.dat" --policy="pcr.policy"

tpm2_policyauthvalue --session="trialsession.ctx" --policy="pcr.policy"

tpm2_flushcontext "trialsession.ctx"

# Connect encrypted to the TPM with key enforcement (TOFU)
tpm2_startauthsession --policy-session --session="session.ctx" --key-context="tpm_owner.pub"

tpm2_sessionconfig "session.ctx"
# -> Session-Attributes: continuesession|decrypt|encrypt

### Authorized policies

The current implementation doen't need authorized policies. The next release will most probably include them to do advanced updates without
the need for a recovery key.

## Bugs and problems found

When many TPM (policy) sessions are created and not freed after use, a kernel bug could be triggered. When that happens, the TPM will not
answer anymore to any commands. A dmesg output will then show problems. The expected behavior is that tpm2 commands will return an error code.
Therefore a timeout has been implemented in the key tool to prevent endless waiting. To prevent this problem at boot time (the sessions seem
not be be cleared automatically on booting) all TPM sessions are flushed before unsealing in the initrd.

During the unseal at boot time it is possible that the kernel will load (some additional) kernel modules.
If this module loading results in modification to the TPM PCR registers - especially while sectpmctl is doing the unseal - the TPM will return the error code `TPM_RC_PCR_CHANGED`, which prevents the unsealing of the LUKS partition.

To solve this problem a loop is implemented to simply retry unsealing 5 times with a sleep of 2 seconds in between. It seems to be difficult to have a stable parsing of this specific error code, therefore the loop is triggered on all TPM errors at boot time.


### Acer laptops quirks

The first thing to know is that you need to set a BIOS administrator password first. Otherwise the Secure Boot setting are grayed out.

An installation on an Acer Swift 3 SF314-42 laptop caused some problems which needed changes of the source code to enable an installation:

* The Secure Boot DB database is maybe not cleared by entering Setup Mode. Fix: Clear it before installation with "efi-updatevar -d 0 db".
* The Secure Boot DBX database could not to cleared by efi-updatevar. Fix: Comment out clearing and updating of DBX in sectpmctl-boot.
* tpm2_clear fails. Fix: Clear the TPM inside the BIOS, Windows or by executing "echo 5 | sudo tee /sys/class/tpm/tpm0/ppi/request" and remove
tpm2_clear in sectpmctl-tpm.
* tpm2_dictionarylockout fails. That's not good. If the lockout settings are reasonable already, the call can be removed in sectpmctl-tpm.

After a second installation, tpm2_clear and tpm2_dictionarylockout worked unexpectedly. So that could be related to a BIOS or kernel bug
and maybe fixed already.

These tools can be used to read the current Secure Boot and TPM settings:

```
mokutil --sb-state
efi-readvar
sudo tpm2_getcap properties-variable
```

### Gigabyte mainboards

Be carefull with BIOS updates. They may delete the Secure Boot database which then makes use of the recovery password neccessary.
